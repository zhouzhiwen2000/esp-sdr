# ESP-SDR firmware

<img src="docs/espargos-logo.png" width="40%" align="right" alt="ESPARGOS logo">

ESP-SDR turns the ESP32's built-in 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi radio into a
**software-defined radio (SDR)**. It lets you capture the radio signal itself
and process it in software, so you can view the spectrum and study signals
beyond ordinary Wi-Fi packets. No separate SDR hardware is needed. The
ESP32-C5 also supports reception in the 5 GHz band.

With the help of LLMs, we discovered an undocumented debug path that bypasses
the chip's fixed-function Wi-Fi modem. This gives software access to raw
radio samples, called **I/Q samples**, from the built-in receiver. ESP-SDR
currently captures short bursts of these samples and sends them to your
computer over USB or UART for analysis. The ESP32-S31 Function CoreBoard-1
also has an optional [continuous Gigabit Ethernet receiver and host spectrum viewer](docs/s31-ethernet.md).

The diagram shows the hardware's receive and transmit paths; this firmware
supports burst reception on the chips below and half-duplex transmission on
C5/S3. The C61/S31 USB/Ethernet transceiver is available as a
[separate build](legacy/transceiver/README.md).

**Parts of the firmware code are AI-generated.**
While we have a very good understanding of how the IQ sampling functionality works on the ESP32-C61 chip (used in our ESPARGOS One array), making IQ sampling work on the whole range of ESP32 family chips would have been too much work without LLM support.

## Commands and transport

Connect over native USB or a 3.3 V USB-to-UART adapter with crossed TX/RX
and common ground, using the pins above. Both interfaces carry the same
request/response protocol: send newline-terminated ASCII commands and read
text replies. Capture replies also include a binary I/Q payload.

Query `INFO` and `CAPS` to identify the firmware and supported features.
`LIMITS?` reports receive-control limits, `RANGE?` reports the tuning range,
and `TRANSPORT?` identifies the active interface. Configure reception with
`FREQ <MHz>`, `BANDWIDTH <MHz>` and `GAIN` commands.

Request a snapshot with `CAP16 <samples> <rate-index>` for signed 8-bit I/Q
or `CAP20 <samples> <rate-index>` for packed signed 10-bit I/Q. The reply is
`DATA <samples> <crc32-hex> <capture-microseconds>`, followed by exactly
`ceil(samples × bits-per-component × 2 / 8)` binary bytes. Verify the
payload CRC32 before using the samples. Rate indices 0–6 select 80, 40, 20, 10,
8, 4 or 16 MS/s respectively; use only rates advertised by `LIMITS?`.

Finish reading each reply before sending another command. Failures return
`ERR <reason>`. `SYNC <nonce>` echoes the nonce to let clients resynchronize
after an incomplete transfer. One client controls the radio at a time;
`RELEASE` or five seconds of idle time releases it, while other clients
receive `ERR busy`.

## Transmit

C5/S3 firmware advertises `TX REPLAY CW` in `CAPS`. It supports finite IQ
transmission (`TX16`, `TX20`, `TXRUN`, `LOOP16`, `LOOP20`), continuous waveform
replay (`REPLAY16`, `REPLAY20`), and continuous tone (`CW START`). Continuous
output requires a keepalive within five seconds; `RELEASE` stops it and
returns ownership. See [payload formats, rates and command sequences](docs/transmit.md).

## Build and flash

[firmware-targets.json](firmware-targets.json) lists the supported profiles and
pins their ESP-IDF commits, including the preview SDK for S31. Check out the
matching SDK, initialize its submodules, run `install.sh <target>`, and source
`export.sh`.

Use a separate build directory and configuration for each chip:

```sh
idf.py -B build-s3 -DIDF_TARGET=esp32s3 \
  -DSDKCONFIG=sdkconfig.s3 \
  -DSDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=sdkconfig.defaults.esp32s3 build
idf.py -B build-s3 -p /dev/ttyACM0 flash
```

Substitute the target and paths for your chip. S31 also requires `idf.py --preview`.

## Source layout

- `main/targets/<target>/`: chip receiver or adapter, tuning helpers, and the
  linker guard for its capture SRAM. C5/S3 also include `transmitter.h`.
  CMake selects only the requested target.
- `main/families/c5_c6_c61/`: receiver shared by C5, C6, and C61; its `chip.h`
  comes from the selected target directory.
- `main/common/`: burst serial transport, gain control, limits, and bandwidth
  helpers. The gain-table wrapper is linked only for C61 and S31.
- `legacy/transceiver/`: standalone C61/S31 USB/Ethernet transceiver project.
- `main/diagnostics/`: optional register probes, excluded from release exports.
- `platform/esp32s2/`: pinned ROM USB CDC compatibility component.

The application component and UART configuration stay in `main/`. Target SDK
defaults stay at the repository root for the build tools and ESP-IDF defaults
lookup. The default root firmware uses the burst protocol over UART/native USB.
For S31 Ethernet reception, use the [dedicated configuration and host application](docs/s31-ethernet.md).
The full Ethernet/vendor USB transceiver in `legacy/transceiver/` uses its own
SDK, PHY dependencies and board configuration.

Run `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` for host checks. Build every profile
with `tools/build_firmware.py` and its pinned SDK before distributing a change;
the CI matrix does this automatically. Preserve the target SRAM guards and
gain-table linker wrappers when moving or refactoring receiver code.

## Receive controls

Hardware AGC is the default. `GAIN MANUAL <index>` sets manual gain;
`GAIN HARDWARE` restores AGC. `LIMITS?` reports available gain indices,
bandwidths, sample rates and bit depths. `BANDWIDTH <MHz>` sets approximate
analog bandwidth; zero selects the widest setting.

All eight chips accept tuning attempts from **100–6000 MHz in 1 MHz steps**.
The viewer shows an informational warning outside 2400–2483.5 MHz, with
5150–5895 MHz also treated as the supported 5 GHz Wi-Fi band on C5. The warning never blocks tuning.
These are software attempt limits; the expanded range has not been hardware
validated.

- **ESP32:** 80/40/16 MS/s.
- **C3:** 80 MS/s; 14–62 MHz analog bandwidth.
- **C5:** 11–48 MHz bandwidth; selects its 5 GHz RF path above 3000 MHz.
- **C61:** 80/40/20/10/8/4 MS/s; 13–54 MHz bandwidth.
- **C6:** 80 MS/s; 12–54 MHz bandwidth.
- **S2:** 80/40/16 MS/s; 15–60 MHz bandwidth; up to 12,284 complex samples.
- **S3:** 13–69 MHz bandwidth.
- **S31:** 80/40/20/10/8/4 MS/s; 13–54 MHz bandwidth.

Serial burst captures have gaps; nominal sample rates exceed sustained serial throughput.
Gain and power are uncalibrated. Extended tuning does not guarantee PLL lock
or reception; the viewer uses the ISM-band warning described above.
